title: I said I'll be back, and I am
---

The last time I wrote a [blog entry](http://saynay.blogspot.com), I was still in my twenties. I had promised to myself that I will be back, and write more, and then I mercilessly broke that promise...until now!

Hey world, I'm back! Life has taken a few turns since I last troubled my fingers to hit the "publish" for a blog. I'm a placid, caffeinated, Pacific North westerner now. Things turned a little too lucky for me last year when I got married to a beautiful, and lovely lady. I've a learnt a few new things, seen a few new events, and put on some new facade.

I'm back, and blogging like a hacker! The clean markdown flavored syntax has inspired me to start my new journey here. I've a shiny new [Github account](https://github.com/KumarL) too, where I plan to publish interesting pieces of code as I write them. I already have a tool, [`Ek`](https://github.com/kumarl/Ek), shared on GitHub, and that would be the topic of my next post. Promise!
